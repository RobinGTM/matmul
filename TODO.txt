x Wrap SAF/hard adders in single adder
x same for muls
x rework MAC
x pipeline DSPs / workers / worker chain
~ test and validate
x 312.5MHz!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  x 300x300_saf
  x 400x400_saf
x SAF pipelining????????????
- why no XDMA dcp in TCL script??
x Better BRAM mapping (output pipelining)
  x SV inline blackbox
  x Problem: writes filename at the end of generated SV
    (--split-verilog)

x synth / impl all and benchmark again

- Make SLR constraints work and verify they impact timing closure
  (seen on 10x5, not on 300x300)
  - ooooooor don't talk about it

- Chisel annotations to generate XDC constraint files?

x XPM_FIFO_ASYNC integration
- merge xpm-fifos branch
